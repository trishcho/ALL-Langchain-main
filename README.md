# All-LangChain-Main

### Overview
This repository provides an end-to-end implementation of various LangChain modules integrated with advanced AI technologies, including GROQ and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Each module demonstrates practical applications and integration patterns for building robust and scalable AI solutions.

### Modules
- **GROQ_DEMO**: Implementation showcasing GROQ's capabilities in accelerating AI model inference within the LangChain framework.
- **LANGSERV_API**: A service API built with LangChain for serving language models and handling complex NLP tasks.
- **LANGSMITH_CHATBOT**: A conversational AI agent using LangSmith for enhancing chat interactions with contextual understanding.
- **RAG_AGENT**: Demonstrates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **RETRIEVER_CHAIN**: Implementation of an efficient data retrieval system using LangChainâ€™s advanced retrieval mechanisms.
